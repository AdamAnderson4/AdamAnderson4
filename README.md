## Hello Everyone, My name is Adam Anderson 👋
I am a student at the DePaul University and I am studying Computer Science(BS) | I am from Chicago IL.

I enjoy Computer Science as it allows me to express myself creatively while also challenging myself with things like problem solving and working in a team.

Here are some of my projects💻:
-

➕GPA Calculator for Students - Python | [Here](https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/gpa-calculator-e2vzlc/run) |
Students are able to enter in their grades for their classes and get their GPA calculated for them. Students can use this to stay on track in school. I co-created this app with my freind Nathan Czesak for a class in my grade 11 Computer Science class.

🍎'Lift Lab' a Diet App - Kotlin in Android Studio | [Here](https://github.com/Lift-Lab/Project-Final-In-Class-Version-) |
Users are able to track their food eaten throughout the day to help them reach their diet goals. The app tracks calories, protien, carbs, fats, and many micronutrients. We implented a barcode scanner to make the app easier for the users. We also offer an AI that will answer any diet question using the users data like their weight, age, and diet goals. I co-created this app in my Senior class in high school called Software Engineering with my friends Nathan Czesak and Luke Kolozsy. Please see the 'ReadMe' section of our Github for pictures and videos of the app as well as a better desscription of the app.

What im working on now👨‍💻:
-
🏃‍♂️'Flexibility Fix' an App for improving posture and flexibility - Flutter(Dart) in VS | I am currently working on this app now. It uses the users camera on their phone to track their progress with their posture and flexibility. To help the user out, I am implementing AI to be an assistant in offereing various stretching routines and ideas. I am also adding videos for demonstation to make the overall experience better for the user.
